This is the front end for the WBW CRM.

The purpose of this is to display each page that the user sees on the website. 

Using the different routes from the backend (/workers, /customers, /workercustomers, etc.) we gain the needed data as well as post new data to update the database.

The front end utilizes React.js along with Redux
